# H2O - Hex to Object compiler
H2O is a simple tool to convert a hex file into an object. I created it to "compile" the binary test for Hav, MG, us and Voo. The usage is pretty simple and the code readable. If you want implement some additional features you are welcome.

## Build
```
$ gcc src/h2o.c src/__entry.c -o h2o
```
